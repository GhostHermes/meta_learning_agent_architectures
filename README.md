# meta_learning_agent_architectures

This repository explores the design and implementation of autonomous AI agents that employ meta-learning techniques to improve their own architectures and adaptability. The project integrates AutoGen for agent management and a local inference server using LM Studio models. 

## Description

The goal is to create agents that can analyze their own performance, experiment with different neural architectures, and dynamically evolve to become more effective. This research leverages a powerful Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF language model hosted within LM Studio.

## Motivation

* **Enhanced Autonomy:**  Meta-learning empowers agents to self-optimize, enabling greater autonomy and reducing the need for manual fine-tuning.
* **Improved Adaptation:** Agents that can modify their own architectures have the potential to better adapt to changing environments and novel tasks.

## Dependencies

* AutoGen
* LM Studio
* PyTorch (or your preferred deep learning framework)
* NumPy
* [Other relevant libraries] 

## Usage Example

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import autogen 
from my_agent_definitions import BaseAgent 
...

# Load LM Studio model configuration
lm_studio_config = ... 

# Create a base agent
agent = BaseAgent(lm_studio_config)

# Setup meta-learning experiment (this is just a sketch)
meta_optimizer = ...
evaluation_environment = ...

for iteration in range(num_iterations):
    results = agent.run_in_environment(evaluation_environment)
    meta_optimizer.update_agent_architecture(agent, results) 

Research Questions
What meta-learning techniques are most effective for evolving neural network architectures within the constraints of local inference servers?
How can AutoGen be leveraged to manage the meta-learning process and communication with the LM Studio model?
Can evolved agents demonstrate superior adaptability compared to fixed-architecture agents in dynamic environments?
